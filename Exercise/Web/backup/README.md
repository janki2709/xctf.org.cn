## Description
Teacher X forgot to delete the backup file. He sent Xiao Ning to find out the backup file. Let's help Xiao Ning!

## Solution
It is clear from the hint that we need to find backup file.   
It was stated on the webpage that Do you know the name of the backup file for index.php?  
So I got hint that index.php should be involved.  
Then I searched for backup file extension.  
index.php.bak worked well for me.  
After opening, one file got downloaded.  
I opened that with notepad++.  
And I got the flag in that file
