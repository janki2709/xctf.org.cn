## Description
Teacher X told Xiao Ning that HTTP usually uses two request methods. Do you know which two are?

## Solution
We know that HTTP usually uses GET and POST request methods.  
By opening challenge URL, we get webpage saying   
Please use GET to submit a variable named a and value 1  
So submit URL by appending ?a=1  
We get another webpage saying  
Please use GET to submit a variable named a and value 1  
Please use POST to submit a variable named b with a value of 2.

I tried to submit post value b=2 with burpsuite but it didn't worked, I don't know why  
So, I go for Hackbar(Popular firefox/chrome extension)   
Submitted post request with b=2 and get request ?a=1
