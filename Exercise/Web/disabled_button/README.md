## Description
Teacher X taught the front-end knowledge in class today, and then gave everyone a button that could not be pressed.    
Xiao Ning was surprised to find that the button could not be pressed down. How could he press it down?

## Solution
Open webpage, and according to Description we can't click on flag.  
Right click->Inspect   
We can notice in the form that flag button is disabled. 
![notice that button is disabled](https://github.com/janki2709/xctf.org.cn/blob/master/Exercise/Web/disabled_button/disabled_button.png) 
So just remove the disabled from the input tag and then click on the flag.  
Just that! Here you go for flag.
