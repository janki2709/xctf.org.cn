## Description
Teacher X taught the front-end knowledge in class today, and then gave everyone a button that could not be pressed.    
Xiao Ning was surprised to find that the button could not be pressed down. How could he press it down?

## Solution
Open webpage, and according to Description we can't click on flag.  
Right click->Inspect   
We can notice in the form that flag button is disabled.  
So just remove the disabled from the input tag and then click on the flag.  
Just that! Here you go for flag.
