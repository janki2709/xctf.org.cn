## Description
Teacher X told Xiaoning that xff and referer can be faked.

## Solution
By opening link, we get webpage stating   
ip address must be 123.123.123.123  
It's clear from the description that we either need to change X-Forwarded-For or Referer  
Value of X-Forwarded-For should be an IP Address and Value of Referer should be Website.  
So let's change the value of X-Forwarded-For:123.123.123.123  
Open the burpsuite and capture request.  
Add X-Forwarded-For:123.123.123.123 in the request.  
![get and post request](https://github.com/janki2709/xctf.org.cn/blob/master/Exercise/Web/get_post/get_post1.png)    
So, we got another webpage saying   
Must be from https://www.google.com   
Pretty clear we need to change Referer:https://www.google.com  
So, After changing the value   
X-Forwarded-For:123.123.123.123  
Referer:https://www.google.com  
![get and post request](https://github.com/janki2709/xctf.org.cn/blob/master/Exercise/Web/get_post/get_post1.png)    
we Got the flag
